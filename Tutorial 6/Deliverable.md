## Deliverable:

**FOXP3 (forkhead box P3), is a protein involved in immune system responses. FOXP3 appears to function as a master regulator of the regulatory pathway in the development and function of regulatory T cells. Regulatory T cells generally turn the immune response down. Search for “foxp3” in UCSC, you will get a lot of entries that match this search term, select the ones which has corresponding PDB entry.**

(d) What are the Three first and three last nucleotides of intron 1? 

(e) Are there any common SNPs in the coding region? What is the identifier of SNP? What is the class of this SNP? Find its position. 

(f) Are there any common SNPs between Exon 5 and Exon 6? What is the identifier of SNP? What is the name of its class? Find its position. Does this cause change to the encoded amino acid? Why?
